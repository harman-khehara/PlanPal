<p align="center">This personal care app is designed to manage work/study schedules efficiently using psychologically certified techniques.</p>

<p align="center">The app features three modes of auto-generated schedules: Non-custom schedules with two types, Longer Periods and Shorter Periods, and a Custom Schedule. The custom and non-custom schedules cannot be modified once they've been generated. The non-custom schedules have restricted timings for studying activities based on the research behind studying for shorter versus longer periods of time. </p>

<p align="center"><b>The main features of this app include:</b></p>
<p align="center">1. Auto-generate a personalized schedule that fits to the userâ€™s demands and specifications.</p>
<p align="center">2. Push notifications for reminders about taking care of your personal health such as hydrating, taking a break, etc.</p>

  <dt>Push Notifications</dt>
  <dd align="center">PlanPal offers scheduled push notifications and in-app notifications relating to personal health and wellness. Notifications reminding the user to take a hydration break are scheduled every 20-30 minutes to maintain the user's health while working through the tasks the user has scheduled for the day. These notifications can be viewed through the notification bar of the mobile device while the app is running in the background or, can be viewed directly on the homepage of the app if the user is currently using the app. The user also has the option to click directly on the push notification received through the mobile device which will take the user to the PlanPal app directly.
