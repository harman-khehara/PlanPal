<h1>Smart Schedule Creator</h1>

<p>This personal care app is designed to manage work/study schedules efficiently using psychologically certified techniques.</p>

<p>The app features three modes of auto-generated schedules: Non-custom schedules with two types, Longer Periods and Shorter Periods, and a Custom Schedule. With the exception of the custom schedule, the non-custom schedules cannot be modified once they've been generated. The non-custom schedules have restricted timings for studying activities based on the research behind studying for shorter versus longer periods of time. </p>

<p>The main features of this app include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Auto-generate a personalized schedule that fits to the userâ€™s demands and specifications.</li>
  <li>Push notifications for reminders about taking a break, starting the next task, hydrating, etc. </li>
</ol>
