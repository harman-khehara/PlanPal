<h1 align="center">Smart Schedule Creator</h1>

<p align="center">This personal care app is designed to manage work/study schedules efficiently using psychologically certified techniques.</p>

<p align="center">The app features three modes of auto-generated schedules: Non-custom schedules with two types, Longer Periods and Shorter Periods, and a Custom Schedule. With the exception of the custom schedule, the non-custom schedules cannot be modified once they've been generated. The non-custom schedules have restricted timings for studying activities based on the research behind studying for shorter versus longer periods of time. </p>


<p align="center">The main features of this app include:</p>
<p align="center">1. Auto-generate a personalized schedule that fits to the user’s demands and specifications.</p>
<p align="center">2. Push notifications for reminders about taking a break, starting the next task, hydrating, etc. <i>(currently not implemented)</i></p>

  <dt>Short Study Schedule</dt>
    <dd align="center">The short study schedule option allows you to study in multiple <b>1 hour</b> time intervals with <b>10 minute breaks</b>. The user input for this schedule consists of the tasks the user would like to work on for the day, the amount of time the user would like to spend per task, the times they are unavailable, a start time as well as a date for the schedule to be generated. The short study schedule option caters best to individuals who prefer to work for short periods of time.
