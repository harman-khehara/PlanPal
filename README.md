# Smart Schedule Creator
This personal care app is designed to manage work/study schedules efficiently using psychologically certified techniques.

The app features three modes of auto-generated schedules: Non-custom schedules with two types, Longer Periods and Shorter Periods, and a Custom Schedule. With the exception of the custom schedule, the non-custom schedules cannot be modified once they've been generated. The non-custom schedules have restricted timings for studying activities based on the research behind studying for shorter versus longer periods of time. 

The main features of this app include: 

1. Auto-generate a personalized schedule that fits to the user’s demands and specifications
2. Push notifications for reminders about taking a break, starting the next task, hydrating, etc.
